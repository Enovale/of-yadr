# TODO

- Translation documentation works at least, but it really sucks to read.
- Plugin mysteriously segfaults spcomp for sourcemod 1.11 so compatibility is currently impossible.
- Add bridging discord messages between other channels the bot is attached to.
- Maybe make log4sp optional via a separate build with a custom define?
- Add admin commands like psay, ban, kick (Will require additions to sm-ext-discord)
