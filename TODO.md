# TODO

- Add Updater support with github pages and an action for releases
- Make all english strings translated
    - Unsure whether or not to include commands and their documentation. It would kind of suck.
- Translation documentation works at least, but it really sucks to read.
- Maybe make log4sp optional via a separate build with a custom define?
- Would really like to add a generic server command to send discord messages so that other plugins can integrate with the relay
- An include with a few stocks would be even better (e.g. Call for Admin command that pings a moderator)
