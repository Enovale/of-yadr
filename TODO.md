# TODO

- Make all english strings translated
  - Unsure whether or not to include commands and their documentation. It would kind of suck.
- Translation documentation works at least, but it really sucks to read.
- Maybe make log4sp optional via a separate build with a custom define?
- Add arbitrary cvar to translations via ReplaceString
