# TODO

- Make all english strings translated
    - Unsure whether or not to include commands and their documentation. It would kind of suck.
- Translation documentation works at least, but it really sucks to read.
- Plugin mysteriously segfaults spcomp for sourcemod 1.11 so compatibility is currently impossible.
- Maybe make log4sp optional via a separate build with a custom define?
- Would really like to add a generic command to send discord messages so that other plugins can integrate with the relay
- An include with a few stocks would be even better (e.g. Call for Admin command that pings a moderator)
- Make the Report event configurable to only specific channels so that they can ping a moderator without spam
