# Yet Another Discord Relay for SourceMod

Proper readme WIP

> [!WARNING]  
> This project has only been tested with Open Fortress on Sourcemod 1.12.
> Absolutely no testing has been done with other configurations, though they should theoretically work.
> I would love reports to be made in the Issues section if issues are found in other games/setups

Until 1.0, the Translation format will break FREQUENTLY, and this can cause sensitive info to be leaked accidentally.

# Building

I highly recommend [Sourcepawn Studio](https://github.com/Sarrus1/sourcepawn-studio).
With a proper setup it can create a seamless workflow and means I don't have to push hacky scripts to my repository.
